Built while learning React by following tutorials and independently debugging and improving the application logic.

I didn’t “just build a movie app”. I learned:

React Fundamentals

Component structure
Props & state
Conditional rendering
Event handling

 State Management (BIG DEAL)

Context API
Global state
Avoiding duplicate data
ID-based logic bugs

 Side Effects & Lifecycle
 
useEffect
Dependency arrays
Why state resets on refresh
Lazy initialization pattern

 Persistence

localStorage
Syncing state safely
Preventing overwrite bugs

 Debugging Mindset

Finding ID mismatch (id vs imdbID)
Understanding truthy vs falsy (favorites.length)
Fixing UI logic instead of rewriting everything

 Professional Practices
 
Environment variables
.gitignore

Clean folder structure

Preparing a project for GitHub
